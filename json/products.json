With support for DirectX® 12 Ultimate, Auto HDR, AMD Radeon graphics, and Radeon™ software all stand ready to supercharge your gaming experience with Windows 11.  WINDFORCE 2X COOLING SYSTEM The WINDFORCE 2X cooling system features two unique blade fans, alternate spinning, composite copper heat pipes, copper plate and 3D active fan, which together provide high efficiency heat dissipation.  ALTERNATE SPINNING Alternate Spinning can reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase air pressure.  SMOOTH AIRFLOW GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface.  GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of sleeve bearing fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter.  HEAT PIPES AND COPPER PLATE The shape of the pure copper heat pipe contacts with the GPU through a copper plate.  ULTRA COOLING Lower RDS(on) MOSFETs are specially designed to produce lower switching resistance for faster electric current charging and discharging at extremely low temperature.  LOW POWER LOSS Metal Choke hold energy much longer than common iron-core chokes at high frequency, thus effectively reduce core energy loss and EMI interference.  LONGER LIFE Lower ESR Solid Capacitors ensure better electronic conductivity for excellent system performance and longer lifespan.  FRIENDLY PCB DESIGN Fully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface. This friendly design prevents your hands from getting cut or inadvertently damaging components when making your build.",

With support for DirectX® 12 Ultimate, Auto HDR, AMD Radeon graphics, and Radeon™ software all stand ready to supercharge your gaming experience with Windows 11.  WINDFORCE 3X COOLING SYSTEM The WINDFORCE 3X cooling system features three unique blade fans, alternate spinning, composite copper heat pipe directly touches GPU, Screen cooling and 3D active fan, which together provide high efficiency heat dissipation.  ALTERNATE SPINNING Alternate Spinning can reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase air pressure.  SMOOTH AIRFLOW GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface.  GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of sleeve bearing fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter.  SCREEN COOLING Extended heatsink design allows air flow to pass through, providing better heat dissipation.  HEAT PIPES DIRECT TOUCH The shape of the pure copper heat pipe maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU.  PROTECTION BACK PLATE The back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.  ULTRA COOLING Lower RDS(on) MOSFETs are specially designed to produce lower switching resistance for faster electric current charging and discharging at extremely low temperature.  LOW POWER LOSS Metal Choke hold energy much longer than common iron-core chokes at high frequency, thus effectively reduce core energy loss and EMI interference.  LONGER LIFE Lower ESR Solid Capacitors ensure better electronic conductivity for excellent system performance and longer lifespan.  FRIENDLY PCB DESIGN Fully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface. This friendly design prevents your hands from getting cut or inadvertently damaging components when making your build.",

ALTERNATE SPINNING The GIGABYTE patent “Alternate Spinning” is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of adjacent fans. Since the adjacent fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.  ULTRA COOLING Lower RDS(on) MOSFETs are specially designed to produce lower switching resistance for faster electric current charging and discharging at extremely low temperature.  LOW POWER LOSS Metal Choke hold energy much longer than common iron-core chokes at high frequency, thus effectively reduce core energy loss and EMI interference.  LONGER LIFE Lower ESR Solid Capacitors ensure better electronic conductivity for excellent system performance and longer lifespan.  IN TOTAL COMMAND The actual software UI and functionalities depend on each device model.  AORUS ENGINE The cutting edge intuitive interface allows you to adjust the clock speed, voltage, fan performance and power target in real-time according to your game’s requirements.  - Powered by GeForce® GTX 1650 - Integrated with 4GB GDDR5 128-bit memory interface - WINDFORCE 2X Cooling System with alternate spinning fans - 80 mm unique blade fan",

ALTERNATE SPINNING Alternate Spinning can reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase air pressure.  SMOOTH AIRFLOW GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface.  GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of sleeve bearing fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter.

		"Description": "Asus ROG Strix Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 OC Edition 8GB GDDR6 Graphics Card 90YV0HI1-M0NA00 TAKE FLIGHT From top to bottom, the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3050 has been designed to push performance boundaries. A fresh design and more metal surrounds a grouping of Axial-tech fans that leverage a new rotation scheme. Below the blades, a larger, more impressive heatsink is ready for the most demanding thermal loads. The PCB has some new tricks up its sleeves, and even the backplate has received some performance-boosting changes. For gamers who want to get the most out of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the latest addition to the ROG Strix stable delivers in every way.  AXIAL-TECH FAN DESIGN Three cutting edge fans feature a smaller hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring to increase downward air pressure.  NEW DIRECTIONS The two side fans spin counterclockwise to reduce turbulence. And to eliminate unnecessary noise, a stop mode halts all fans when the GPU temp falls below 42 degrees and power consumption is low.  MAXCONTACT To get heat up off the die and into the heatsink array to benefit from the new fan design requires special attention. We use a manufacturing process that polishes the surface of the heat spreader to improve smoothness at the microscopic level. The extra flatness allows for better contact with the die for improved thermal transfer.  2.7-SLOT DESIGN The heat spreader draws heat up into heatpipes that carry it through a fin stack that fills most of the card’s large, 2.7-slot footprint.  FRESH SHROUD In addition to under-the-hood design changes, the ROG Strix features a new face with metal accents that mirror the design aesthetic of ROG and ROG Strix motherboards. Textured accents in a greyscale colorway blend seamlessly into subtle builds or make a striking impact while the card is vertically mounted and lit by chassis LEDs.  IT’S COOLER OUT BACK Flipping the card around reveals more design improvements. For enhanced heat dissipation, a wide backplate vent and shortened PCB allow hot air to escape towards chassis exhaust fans instead of being recycled back into the cooler. The I/O bracket is made from stainless steel to protect ports and provide a more secure mount. A conveniently placed Dual BIOS switch allows quick selection between “performance” and “quiet” mode for basic customization of the card’s default behavior without software. To top it off, an ROG logo with addressable RGB backlighting adds flair.  FUNCTIONAL FRONT A new addressable RGB element lines the front edge of the card and can be customized with Armoury Crate software to sync lighting and effects with other ROG components. To fulfill the power demands of the GeForce RTX 3050, an 8-pin power connector is present, along with an onboard circuit that monitors PSU rail voltage. The circuit is fast enough to catch any transients that result in the rail voltage dropping too low. If that happens, a red LED will light up to indicate a power supply issue.",

		"Description": "PNY Nvidia Quadro T1000 4GB GDDR6 128-bit Low Profile Graphics Card PNY_T1000-PB Features Turing GPU Architecture Based on state-of-the-art 12nm FFN (FinFET NVIDIA) high-performance manufacturing process customized for NVIDIA to incorporate 896 CUDA cores, the NVIDIA T1000 GPU is the most powerful low-profile single slot professional solution for CAD, DCC, financial service industry (FSI) and visualization professionals in general looking to reach excellence performance in a compact and efficient form factor. The Turing GPU architecture enables the biggest leap in computer real-time graphics rendering since NVIDIA’s invention of programmable shaders in 2001.   Advanced Shading Technologies The Turing GPU architecture features the following new advanced shader technologies. Mesh Shading: Compute-based geometry pipeline to speed geometry processing and culling on geometrically complex models and scenes. Mesh shading provides up to 2x performance improvement on geometry-bound workloads.   Advanced Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) Architecture Combined shared memory and L1 cache improve performance significantly, while simplifying programing and reducing the tuning required to attain best application performance. Each SM contains 96 KB of L1 shared memory, which can be configured for various capabilities depending on compute or graphics workload. For compute cases, up to 64KB can be allocated to the L1 cache or shared memory, while graphics workload can allocate up to 48 KB for shared memory; 32 KB for L1 and 16KB for texture units. Combining the L1 data cache with the shared memory reduces latency and provide higher bandwidth.   High Performance GDDR6 Memory Built with Turing’s vastly optimized 4GB GDDR6 memory subsystem for the industry’s fastest graphics the NVIDIA T1000 features 4 GB of frame buffer capacity and 160 GB/s of peak bandwidth for double the throughput from previous generation. NVIDIA T1000 is the ideal platform for 3D professionals working with larger models and datasets and multi display environments.   Single Instruction, Multiple Thread (SIMT) New independent thread scheduling capability enables finer-grain synchronization and cooperation between parallel threads by sharing resources among small jobs.   Mixed-Precision Computing With independent parallel integer and floating-point data paths, the Turing SM is more efficient on workloads with a mix of computation and addressing calculations.   Compute Preemption Preemption at the instruction-level provides finer grain control over compute tasks to prevent long-running applications from either monopolizing system resources or timing out.   H.264 and HEVC Encode/Decode Engines Deliver faster than real-time performance for transcoding, video editing, and other encoding applications with two dedicated H.264 and HEVC encode engines and a dedicated decode engine that are independent of 3D/compute pipeline.   NVIDIA GPU BOOST 4.0 Automatically maximize application performance without exceeding the power and thermal envelope of the card. Allows applications to stay within the boost clock state longer under higher temperature threshold before dropping to a secondary temperature setting base clock.   Full-Scene Antialiasing (FSAA) Dramatically reduce visual aliasing artifacts or 'jaggies' with up to 64x FSAA (128x with SLI) for unparalleled image quality and highly realistic scenes.   32K Texture and Render Processing Texture from and render to 32K x 32K surfaces to support applications that demand the highest resolution and quality image processing.   NVIDIA Mosaic Technology Transparently scale the desktop and applications across up to 4 GPUs and 16 displays from a single workstation while delivering full performance and image quality.   DisplayPort 1.4 Support up to four 5K monitors at 60Hz, or dual 8K displays per card. NVIDIA T1000 supports 4x displays natively, HDR color for 4K at 120Hz for 10/12b HEVC decode and up to 4K at 60Hz for 10b HEVC encode. Each DisplayPort connector is capable of driving ultra-high resolutions of 4096 x 2160 at 120 Hz with 30-bit color.   NVIDIA RTX Desktop Manager NVIDIA RTX Desktop Manager software allows you to manage single or multi-monitor workspaces with ease, giving you maximum flexibility and control over your display real estate and desktops.   OpenGL Quad Buffered Stereo Support Provide a smooth and immersive 3D Stereo experience for professional applications.   NVIDIA Enterprise Management Tools Maximize system uptime, seamlessly manage wide-scale deployments and remotely control graphics and display settings for efficient operations.    Technical Specification CUDA Cores: 896 GPU Memory: 4 GB GDDR6 Peak FP32 Performance: 2.50 TFLOPS Memory Interface: 128-bit Memory Bandwidth: 160 GB/s Max Power Consumption: 50 W System Interface: PCI Express 3.0 x16 Display Connectors: 4x mDP Max Digital Resolution: 7680 x 4320 at 60 Hz Max Displays: 4x at 5K | 5120 x 2880 at 60 Hz HDR Support: Yes Quad Buffered Stereo: Yes NVENC | NVDEC: 2x H.264 and HVEC Encoders, 1x Decode Engine Form Factor: Low-Profile Single Slot Thermal Solution: Active Fansink",

ALTERNATE SPINNING Alternate Spinning can reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase air pressure.  SMOOTH AIRFLOW GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface.  GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter.  SCREEN COOLING Extended heatsink design allows air flow to pass through, providing better heat dissipation.  HEAT PIPES DIRECT TOUCH The shape of the pure copper heat pipe maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU. The heat pipe also covers the VRAM through a large metal plate contact to ensure proper cooling.  RGB FUSION 2.0 With 16.7M customizable color options and numerous lighting effects, you can choose lighting effects or synchronize with other AORUS devices.  PROTECTION METAL BACK PLATE The metal back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.  POWER INDICATOR When experiencing any power supply abnormality, the indicator will alert gamers by flashing light.  EXTREME DURABILITY AND OVERCLOCKING The graphics card uses the better power phase design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life.  FRIENDLY PCB DESIGN Fully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface.

Cooling type: Active, Number of fans: 2 fan(s) ASUS Dual Radeon™ RX 6750 XT OC Edition 12GB GDDR6 is armed to dish out frames and keep vitals in check. 2x Fans. 2x Fun. Delivering the latest AMD RDNA™ 2 architecture experience in its purest form, the ASUS Dual Radeon™ RX 6750 XT melds performance and simplicity like no other. Leveraging advanced cooling technologies derived from flagship graphics cards, the Dual opts for substance over style, the perfect choice for a well-balanced build. Buckle up and engage cutting-edge gaming prowess. COOLING Axial-tech Fan Design Better, faster, stronger Two tried-and-true Axial-tech fans feature a smaller hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring to increase downward air pressure. 0dB Technology Quiet intelligence An advanced onboard controller brings fans to a standstill when the GPU core temperature is below 55 Celsius, letting you enjoy light gaming in relative silence. As temps rise past the threshold, the fans automatically start up again. Dual Ball Fan Bearings 2x longer lifespan Different bearing types have unique pros and cons. Ball bearings excel at durability and can last up to twice as long as sleeve bearing designs. Dual BIOS Choose wisely Do you prioritize low core temps or low noise levels? Performance mode will let the fans spin up to keep the card running cool all the time. Quiet mode keeps the same power target and top-end settings, but offers a less aggressive fan curve for quieter operation at medium temps. For even more customization and control, check out our GPU Tweak II software. ENGINEERING Auto-Extreme Technology Precision automated manufacturing Auto-Extreme Technology is an automated manufacturing process that sets new standards in the industry by allowing all soldering to be completed in a single pass. This reduces thermal strain on components and avoids the use of harsh cleaning chemicals, resulting in less environmental impact, lower manufacturing power consumption, and a more reliable product overall.

		"Description": "ASUS TUF Gaming TUF-RX6800XT-O16G-GAMING. Graphics processor family: AMD, Graphics processor: Radeon RX 6800 XT. Discrete graphics adapter memory: 16 GB, Graphics adapter memory type: GDDR6, Memory bus: 256 bit. Maximum resolution: 7680 x 4320 pixels. DirectX version: 12.0. Interface type: PCI Express 4.0BUILT TUF The TUF GAMING Radeon™ RX 6800 XT is a tenacious beast with a tough metal exterior, super-efficient cooling, and components that offer enhanced endurance. An all-metal shroud houses three powerful axial-tech fans with dual ball fan bearings and extra blades. Under the exoskeleton, a thick heatsink keeps thermals under tight control and TUF components, selected for maximum durability and performance, keep the card ahead of the pack. You asked for a mean machine... this one is ready for action.  BIGGER, BETTER COOLING This generation, our Axial-tech fan design has matured with an increased blade count on all three fans: 13 on the center fan and 11 on the auxiliary fans. The barrier rings on the side fans have been slimmed down to allow for more lateral intake and to provide better airflow through the cooling array. The center fan's extra blades and full-height ring provide boosted static pressure to blast air directly onto the GPU heat spreader. The fan design growth is specifically optimized for a massive new heatsink that features more fins and surface area than previous iterations.  MAXCONTACT To get heat up off the die and into the heatsink array, we've engaged MaxContact technology to polish the surface of the heat spreader and improve smoothness at the microscopic level. The extra flatness allows for better contact with the die for enhanced thermal transfer.  2.9-SLOT DESIGN The heat spreader draws heat up into heatpipes that carry it through a fin stack that fills most of the card's large, 2.9-slot footprint.  TUF COMPONENTS Robust military-grade capacitors were selected for the card's power design. They and other components are soldered to the PCB using our Auto-Extreme automated manufacturing process. Precise joints and the elimination of human error ensures each graphics card meets our rigorous specifications. To ensure flawless performance when it counts, the cards are subjected to a grueling 144-hour validation trial.  METAL COAT A machined all-aluminum shroud creates a robust outer shell and a no-nonsense industrial design and grayscale colorway fits into any build with ease.  ARMORED UNDERSIDE The underside of the card reveals further improvements. Most of the rear is swathed in a protective metal backplate that prominently features a wide vent. The vent allows hot air to escape towards chassis exhaust fans instead of being recycled back into the GPU cooler. A GPU bracket provides extra stability to the critical connection between die and heat spreader. Stainless steel is used for the I/O bracket to protect ports and provide a more secure mount. And a conveniently placed Dual Bios switch allows customization of the card's default performance profile without software.  FUNCTIONAL FRONT The front-side RGB element can be customized to display a range of aesthetic and functional effects, and also synced with other ASUS components to enable uniform lighting. To fulfill the power demands of the Radeon RX 6800 XT, two 8-pin power connectors are present, along with onboard LEDs that light up if PSU PCIe power connectors are not plugged in correctly. Structural pillars of a built-in reinforced metal frame are also visible here and add a literal layer of durability.  GPU TWEAK II The ASUS GPU Tweak II utility takes graphics card tuning to the next level. It allows you to tweak critical parameters including GPU core clocks, memory frequency, and voltage settings, with the option to monitor everything in real-time through a customizable on-screen display. Advanced fan control is also included along with many more features to help you get the most out of your graphics card. RADEO SOFTWARE The latest Radeon™ Software Adrenalin 2020 Edition unleashes the full potential of your GPU with day-0 drivers optimized for new game releases and a highly customizable gaming experience.",

		"Description": "MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Suprim X 12G 12GB GDDR6X Graphics Card RTX 4070 TI SUPRIM X 12G SUPRIM and its logo concept are inpired by diamond crystals and geometry.  A celebration of decades of MSI graphics card mastery, SUPRIM is crafted with qualities that evoke prestige.  High-quality materials and construction are emphasized by the geometry of points, lines, and planes.  New Streaming Multiprocessors Up to 2x performance and power efficiency  Fourth-Gen Tensor Cores Up to 4x performance with DLSS 3 vs. brute-force rendering  Third-Gen RT Cores Up to 2x ray tracing performance  CHANGE THE GAME Ascend to a superior experience with SUPRIM. See, hear, and feel a profoundly elevated graphics card built with high-quality materials and assembled with enthusiast features.  01. SHARP LOOKS The second iteration of SUPRIM inherits the exterior design philosophy of its predecessor, with a brushed metal cover, octagon-shaped fan cutouts and chevrons around each fan.  02. POLISHED EDGES Beveled edges are polished several times with a diamond-tipped cutter to achieve a mirror-finish. Clean sharp lines emphasize the metal construction to sight and touch.  03. FINISHING TOUCHES The motif of straight lines continue around the fans with octagonal cutouts featuring polished 45-degree beveled edges.  TRI-FROZR 3S THERMAL DESIGN Upgraded fans, airflow control, and other thermal innovation make TRI-FROZR 3S the best air-cooling solution yet from MSI.  TORX FAN 5.0 incorporates design improvements that result in +23% increased airflow compared to an axial fan.  CORE PIPE Core Pipes are precision-crafted to make maximum use of the available space. A squared section of heat pipes fully touch the GPU baseplate to then spread heat along the full length of the heatsink.  FILLED FINS Updated heat pipe pathing has allowed more space for additional heatsink fins  WAVE-CURVED 3.0 Additional efficiency is gained by adjusting the size of the wave edges under the fan motor and other spots where there is less airflow..  AIR ANTEGRADE FIN Fins with a V-shaped cutout are located at the airflow passthrough to improve flow efficiency. Optimizing the inclination angle and increasing the wave notch shapes the air resistance towards the center, pushing out warm air faster like a nozzle.  METAL BACKPLATE Thermal pads under the sturdy metal backplate provide additional cooling while the flow-through ventilation reduces trapped heat.  ZERO FROZR The fans completely stop when temperatures are relatively low, eliminating all noise when active cooling is not needed. The fans will automatically start spinning again when the heat is on during gaming.  DOUBLE-BALL BEARING Two sets of durable ball bearings spin the TORX FANs for years of intense and lengthy gaming sessions.  High-Efficiency CarbonyI Inductors (HCI) Manufacturing and material improvements to our choke parts have culminated as High-Efficiency Carbonyl Inductors (HCI.) One-piece molding allows this design to operate with less choke noise and better electric filtering.  DrMos DrMOS power stage solutions provide great efficiency with low power loss and enhanced voltage controls.  Dual BIOS Dual BIOS gives you the choice to prioritize full performance in GAMING mode or low noise in SILENT mode.  Hardened Defenses - Fuse Additional fuses built into the custom PCB provide additional safeguards against electrical damage.  RELENTLESS DEFENSE A die-cast anti-bending plate reinforces the whole card while thermal pads allow cooling to reach critical component underneath.  BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER MSI's exclusive MSI Center software helps you get the most out of your MSI products. Monitor, tweak, and optimize in real-time with just a few clicks.",

WINDFORCE COOLING SYSTEM THE EVOLVING POWER OF WINDFORCE The WINDFORCE cooling system features three 110mm newly designed bionic shark fans, alternate spinning, 12 composite copper heat pipes, a large vapor chamber directly touches the GPU, 3D active fans and Screen cooling, which together provide high efficiency heat dissipation.  COOLING, UPSCALED. AORUS BIONIC FAN TECH The sharks’ dermal denticles surrounding their body grant them significant advantages in fluid dynamics. Now AORUS features new Bionic Fan Tech that mimics the scale micro-surfacing and efficiently increases airflow by reducing micro turbulence.  DOUBLE BALL BEARING The double ball bearing structure has better heat endurance and efficiency than sleeve.  DIRECTLY. SO FAST. LARGE VAPOR CHAMBER & HEAT-PIPE The large vapor chamber directly contacts the GPU, coupled with the composite heat pipes, which quickly transfers the heat of the GPU and VRAM to the heatsink.  THE OTHER WAY AROUND. ALTERNATE SPINNING Each fan rotates in different direction to the adjacent one. This special mechanism reduces turbulence and increases air pressure by minimizing the offset occurred between airflows.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  MAKE ROOM FOR THE AIRFLOW. SCREEN COOLING To create more space for airflow to pass through, the heatsink extends over the PCB and therefore increase the ventilation. This Screen Cooling design provides better heat dissipation.  LCD EDGE VIEW The LCD monitor displays not only graphics card information, but also various favorite texts, pictures, and GIFs. You can also adjust lighting effects via GIGABYTE CONTROL CENTER.  DUAL BIOS The factory default setting is OC mode, which provides users with the best performance. However, switching to silent mode will enjoy a quieter experience.

		"Description": "Asus ROG Strix Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 24GB GDDR6X Graphics Card 90YV0ID0-M0NA00 WITH THE INCREDIBLE SUM OF ITS PARTS The ROG Strix GeForce RTX® 4090 brings a whole new meaning to going with the flow. Inside and out, every element of the card gives the monstrous GPU headroom to breathe freely and achieve ultimate performance. The unleashed reign of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture is here. Axial-tech Upgrades A Fresh Spin Bigger and better. Axial-tech fans spin on dual-ball bearings and have been scaled up to propel 23% more air through the card, setting the stage for lower temperatures, less noise, and higher performance. Reverse Rotation and 0dB Technology Orchestrated Chill The two side fans spin counterclockwise to minimize turbulence and maximize air dispersion through the heatsink. All three fans come to a standstill when GPU temps are below 50 Celsius, letting you play less-demanding games or perform light tasks in relative silence. Fans start up again when temps are over 55 C, referencing a speed curve that balances performance and acoustics for work or play. 3.5-slot Design Through Thick and Fin The custom sink is generously sized and structured to soak up heat from the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU so that it can be efficiently whisked away by the three Axial-tech fans. Patented Vapor Chamber Phase Changer A vapor chamber featuring milled pathways lets the heatpipes sink in without being pressed flat, allowing heat to be carried more efficiently to the fin stack. In comparison to conventional vapor chamber and heatpipe combos, this potent pairing reduces GPU temperature by up to 5 Celsius when subjected to a 500W thermal load. Premium Power Delivery 1st Responder Digital power control, an array of high-current power stages, and a lineup of 15K caps ensure massive reserves to reliably push performance boundaries. Hook up Two PWM FanConnect headers provide additional DIY flexibility. Chassis fans can be directly attached to the card and tuned with a curve that is based on CPU and GPU temperatures, delivering extra intake or exhaust for demanding 3D tasks. Additional Perks A GPU bracket provides extra stability to the critical connection between die and heat spreader. The rear I/O bracket is made from stainless steel to prevent corrosion in humid climates and provide a more resilient mount. A conveniently placed Dual Bios switch allows quick selection between “performance” and “quiet” speed profiles for the Axial-tech fans. Quick Diagnosis Know if your PSU is worthy. ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards feature a high-speed circuit that constantly monitors input power from the PSU and utilizes conveniently placed LEDs to indicate voltage regulation issues and cable connection problems. Reliability Boost Auto-Extreme Technology is an automated manufacturing process that sets new standards in the industry by allowing all soldering to be completed in a single pass. This reduces thermal strain on components and avoids the use of harsh cleaning chemicals, resulting in less environmental impact, lower manufacturing power consumption, and a more reliable product overall. Symphony of Light Aura-compatible ARGB lighting elements on the shroud and rightmost perimeter of the card provide endless possibilities for personalization with color or functional effects. Pair up with a vast range of compatible system components and coordinate the glow to create a build that’s uniquely you.  - NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Streaming Multiprocessors: Up to 2x performance and power efficiency - 4th Generation Tensor Cores: Up to 2X AI performance - 3rd Generation RT Cores: Up to 2X ray tracing performance - Axial-tech fans scaled up for 23% more airflow - New patented vapor chamber with milled heatspreader for lower GPU temps - 3.5-slot design: massive fin array optimized for airflow from the three Axial-tech fans - Diecast shroud, frame, and backplate add rigidity and are vented to further maximize airflow and heat dissipation - Digital power control with high-current power stages and 15K capacitors to fuel maximum performance - Auto-Extreme precision automated manufacturing for higher reliability - GPU Tweak III software provides intuitive performance tweaking, thermal controls, and system monitoring  Graphics processor family: NVIDIA, Graphics processor: GeForce RTX 4090.
