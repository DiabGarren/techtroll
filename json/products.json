		"Description": "Corsair Vengeance LPX 8GB DDR4 3600MHz Dimm Memory Module DESIGNED FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE OVERCLOCKING VENGEANCE LPX memory is designed for high-performance overclocking. The heatspreader is made of pure aluminum for faster heat dissipation, and the custom performance PCB helps manage heat and provides superior overclocking headroom. Each IC is individually screened for peak performance potential. COMPATIBILITY TESTED Part of our exhaustive testing process includes performance and compatibility testing on nearly every motherboard on the market – and a few that aren’t. XMP 2.0 SUPPORT One setting is all it takes to automatically adjust to the fastest safe speed for your VENGEANCE LPX kit. You’ll get amazing, reliable performance without lockups or other strange behavior. ALUMINUM HEAT SPREADER Overclocking overhead is limited by operating temperature. The unique design of the VENGEANCE LPX heat spreader optimally pulls heat away from the ICs and into your system’s cooling path, so you can push it harder. DESIGNED FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE OVERCLOCKING Each VENGEANCE LPX module is built from an custom performance PCB and highly-screened memory ICs. The efficient heat spreader provides effective cooling to improve overclocking potential. LOW-PROFILE DESIGN The small form factor makes it ideal for smaller cases or any system where internal space is at a premium. MATCH YOUR SYSTEM The best high-performance systems look as good as they run. VENGEANCE LPX is available in several colors to match your motherboard, your other components, your case -- or just your favorite color. The DDR4 form factor is optimized for the latest DDR4 systems and offers higher frequencies, greater bandwidth, and lower power consumption than DDR3 modules. VENGEANCE LPX DDR4 modules are compatibility-tested across DDR4 systems for reliably fast performance. There’s XMP 2.0 support for trouble-free automatic overclocking. And, they’re available in multiple colors to match your personal preference. DESIGNED FOR ENTHUSIASTS. BACKED BY CORSAIR. WORLD-FAMOUS RELIABILITY There's a reason why world-champion overclockers, extreme gaming enthusiasts and high-end system builders all trust CORSAIR for high-performance memory that they can install with confidence and pride.

Designed to help your system run faster and smoother, Crucial® Laptop Memory is one of the easiest and most affordable ways to improve your system’s performance. Load programs faster. Increase responsiveness. Run data-intensive applications with ease, and increase your laptop’s multitasking capabilities.  Make everything on your computer faster Memory is a component in your computer that allows for short-term data access. Since your system’s moment-to-moment operations rely on short-term data access – loading applications, browsing the Web or editing a spreadsheet – the speed and amount of memory in your system plays a critical role. Load apps in seconds by increasing the speed of your memory and installing more of it.   Multitask with ease If you’re like us, you use your computer to do a lot of things at once. You might be editing a document, while also looking at pictures and browsing the internet. This naturally leads to a performance problem: every app you’re running requires memory and competes for a limited pool of resources. Overcome this by installing high-density modules in each memory slot for seamless multitasking.   Install with ease – no computer skills required With just a screwdriver, your owner’s manual, and a few minutes of time, you can install memory – no computer skills necessary. Just watch one of our three-minute install videos, and we’ll walk you step-by-step through the process. Don’t pay a computer shop to do something you can do in minutes!  Maximize the value of your system At a fraction of the cost of a new system, a memory upgrade is one of the most affordable ways to increase performance. Get more out of your laptop by giving it the resources it needs to perform.  Micron® quality – a higher level of reliability. As a brand of Micron, one of the largest memory manufacturers in the world, Crucial Desktop Memory is the standard for reliable performance. From the original SDRAM technology all the way to DDR4, we’ve engineered the memory technologies that have powered the world’s computers for 40 years and counting. When you choose Crucial memory, you’re choosing memory that’s backed by a limited lifetime warranty and designed for the world’s leading systems.1 Don’t settle for anything less.Warranty: Limited Lifetime",

What's more, it features a built-in Power Management IC (PMIC) to enhanced power supply stability. Capacity Doubled This memory module's architecture allows for more memory bank groups and banks. With the same area, more bank groups can be packed into the module, doubling what was possible with DDR4, giving you higher capacities. Improved Stability With on-die error correcting code (ECC) this module can correct errors automatically in real-time to provide increased stability and reliability. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Appearance DDR5 U-DIMM modules have the same dimensions and pin count as DDR4 modules. The most obvious difference is the position of the fool-proof notch. Also, DDR5 integrates I/O resistors with CMD/ADD resistors. Also, the appearance of DDR5 modules are cleaner than DDR4. In addition, you can see a PMIC in the center. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Chip Architecture DDR5 modules provide two times more capacity than DDR4 by packing in more banks and bank groups. In addition, Burst Length and Prefetch are also doubled. And to ensure data integrity, they feature error correcting code (ECC) technology. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Performance The biggest change is that bandwidth and frequency are significantly higher. The ADATA DDR5 memory modules deliver frequencies of up to 4800MT/s and feature bandwidth of 38.4GB/s, which is 50% higher than the DDR4-3200. The maximum frequency is increased 1.63 times compared to DDR4. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Comparison Table This specification comparison table shows the advantages of DDR5.

Reaching frequencies of up to 5200MT/s, it'll give you a major performance boost for gaming and overclocking. Enhanced Power Management The XPG HUNTER DDR5 features a built-in Power Management IC (PMIC) that enhance power supply stability. It's lower operating voltage also make HUNTER more power-efficient than DDR4. Stability and Reliability With On-die error correcting code (ECC), this DDR5 memory module can correct errors in real-time to provide increased stability and reliability. Overclocking Made Easy With support for Intel XMP 3.0, get overclocking easily without the need to constantly hassle with BIOS settings and overclocking parameters. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Appearance DDR5 U-DIMM modules have the same dimensions and pin count as DDR4 modules. The most obvious difference is the position of the fool-proof notch. Also, DDR5 integrates I/O resistors with CMD/ADD resistors. Also, the appearance of DDR5 modules are cleaner than DDR4. In addition, you can see a PMIC in the center. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Chip Architecture DDR5 modules provide two times more capacity than DDR4 by packing in more banks and bank groups. In addition, Burst Length and Prefetch are also doubled. And to ensure data integrity, they feature error correcting code (ECC) technology. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Performance The biggest change is that bandwidth and frequency are significantly higher. The ADATA DDR5 memory modules deliver frequencies of up to 4800MT/s and feature bandwidth of 38.4GB/s, which is 50% higher than the DDR4-3200. The maximum frequency is increased 1.63 times compared to DDR4. Warranty: Limited lifetime",

Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.  Instruction Set Extensions  Instruction Set Extensions are additional instructions which can increase performance when the same operations are performed on multiple data objects. These can include SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions).  Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0  Intel® Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 identifies the best performing core(s) on a processor and provides increased performance on those cores through increasing frequency as needed by taking advantage of power and thermal headroom.  Thermal Monitoring Technologies  Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.  Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost  Intel® Thermal Velocity Boost (Intel® TVB) is a feature that opportunistically and automatically increases clock frequency above single-core and multi-core Intel® Turbo Boost Technology frequencies based on how much the processor is operating below its maximum temperature and whether turbo power budget is available. The frequency gain and duration is dependent on the workload, capabilities of the processor and the processor cooling solution.  Intel® Identity Protection Technology  Intel® Identity Protection Technology is a built-in security token technology that helps provide a simple, tamper-resistant method for protecting access to your online customer and business data from threats and fraud. Intel® IPT provides a hardware-based proof of a unique user’s PC to websites, financial institutions, and network services; providing verification that it is not malware attempting to login. Intel® IPT can be a key component in two-factor authentication solutions to protect your information at websites and business log-ins.  Intel® Stable Image Platform Program (SIPP)  The Intel® Stable Image Platform Program (Intel® SIPP) aims for zero changes to key platform components and drivers for at least 15 months or until the next generational release, reducing complexity for IT to effectively manage their computing endpoints.  Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions  Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel® TSX) are a set of instructions that add hardware transactional memory support to improve performance of multi-threaded software.",

Component for: PC/server, Internal memory: 16 GB, Memory layout (modules x size): 1 x 16 GB, Internal memory type: DDR4, Memory clock speed: 2666 MHz, Memory form factor: 288-pin DIMM, CAS latency: 19, Product colour: Black, Green DRAM is a type of RAM (random access memory) used as the main memory in several computing devices, such as desktop and notebook computers, servers, and high-end workstations. It is the most widely used semiconductor memory used in current generation computers, and offers several significant advantages, such as structural simplicity, very high packing densities (number of bytes that can be stored per unit of chip area), low power consumption, and sufficiently high data read/write speeds. Several types of DRAM are presently available for deployment on various computing platforms, such as home/personal computers, portable computers, and network servers. This type of memory has undergone several innovative technological developments and offers very high price/performance ratios.   Two types of DRAM are widely used for deployment in current generation servers: registered memory, and fully-buffered (FB) memory. Both these memory types are commercially available as DIMMs (dual inline memory modules). Registered DIMMs (or RDIMMs) are designed with an additional hardware register between the DRAM module and the system’s memory controller. RDIMMs present several advantages for the system, such as a lower electrical load on the memory controller and sustained stability even with an increase in the number of installed memory modules. Thus, RDIMMs are often the default choice for deployment in server-class computing systems. Fully-buffered DIMMs (or FB-DIMMs) are intended to be used in systems requiring higher memory densities with limited board space. As opposed to the parallel data transfer technique used in normal DRAM, FB-DIMMs transfer data in a serial format, using an additional buffer, known as advanced memory buffer (AMB) between the memory controller and the FB-DIMM modules. The AMB acts as an intermediary and handles all data reads/writes for the memory modules, taking care of issues such as signal degradation and error correction and reducing any overhead on the memory controller. Thus, FB-DIMMs prove to be a reliable alternative for deployment in server-grade machines.",

		"Description": "Kingston KCP548US8-16 Module Memory 16GB DDR5 4800MHz Greater starting speed performance. DDR5 debuts at 4800MHz, while DDR4 tops out at 3200MHz. This represents a 50% increase in bandwidth. In cadence with compute platform releases, DDR5 has planned performance increases that will scale to 6400MHz. Reduced power / increased efficiency. At 1.1V, DDR5 consumes 20% less power than DDR4 equivalent components at 1.2V. In addition to conserving battery life in laptops, it also has a significant advantage for enterprise servers working around the clock. PMIC. DDR5 modules feature on-board Power Management Integrate Circuits (PMIC), which help regulate the power required by the various components of the memory module (DRAM, register, SPD hub, etc). For server-class modules, the PMIC uses 12V; for PC-class modules, it uses 5V. This makes for better power distribution compared to previous generations, improves signal integrity and reduces noise. SPD hub. DDR5 utilises a new device that integrates the Serial Presence Detect (SPD) EEPROM with additional hub features, manages access to the external controller and decouples the memory load on the internal bus from external.

Designed to help your system run faster and smoother, Crucial© Desktop Memory is one of the easiest and most affordable ways to improve your system’s performance. Load programs faster. Increase responsiveness. Run data-intensive applications with ease, and increase your desktop’s multitasking capabilities.  Make everything on your computer faster Memory is a component in your computer that allows for short-term data access. Since your system’s moment-to-moment operations rely on short-term data access - loading applications, browsing the Web or editing a spreadsheet - the speed and amount of memory in your system plays a critical role. Load apps in seconds by increasing the speed of your memory and installing more of it.  Multitask with ease If you’re like us, you use your computer to do a lot of things at once. You might be editing a document, while also looking at pictures and browsing the Internet. This naturally leads to a performance problem: every app you’re running requires memory and competes for a limited pool of resources. Overcome this by installing high-density modules in each memory slot for seamless multitasking.  Install with ease - no computer skills required With just a screwdriver, your owner’s manual, and a few minutes of time, you can install memory - no computer skills necessary. Just watch one of our three-minute install videos, and we’ll walk you step-by-step through the process. Don’t pay a computer shop to do something you can do in minutes!  Maximize the value of your system At a fraction of the cost of a new system, a memory upgrade is one of the most affordable ways to increase performance. Get more out of your desktop by giving it the resources it needs to perform.  Micron© quality - a higher level of reliability. As a brand of Micron, one of the largest memory manufacturers in the world, Crucial Desktop Memory is the standard for reliable performance. From the original SDRAM technology all the way to DDR4, we’ve engineered the memory technologies that have powered the world’s computers for 40 years and counting. When you choose Crucial memory, you’re choosing memory that’s backed by a limited lifetime warranty and designed for the world’s leading systems. Don’t settle for anything less.",

There is no need to repeatedly adjust and fine-tune overclocking parameters. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Appearance DDR5 U-DIMM modules have the same dimensions and pin count as DDR4 modules. The most obvious difference is the position of the fool-proof notch. Also, DDR5 integrates I/O resistors with CMD/ADD resistors. Also, the appearance of DDR5 modules are cleaner than DDR4. In addition, you can see a PMIC in the center. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Chip Architecture DDR5 modules provide two times more capacity than DDR4 by packing in more banks and bank groups. In addition, Burst Length and Prefetch are also doubled. And to ensure data integrity, they feature error correcting code (ECC) technology. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Performance The biggest change is that bandwidth and frequency are significantly higher. The ADATA DDR5 memory modules deliver frequencies of up to 4800MT/s and feature bandwidth of 38.4GB/s, which is 50% higher than the DDR4-3200. The maximum frequency is increased 1.63 times compared to DDR4.",

DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR4 MEMORY IN A CLASS OF ITS OWN  THE CULMINATION OF 25 YEARS BUILDING WORLD CLASS MEMORY CORSAIR DOMINATOR has long been the face of premium, high-performance memory. That heritage and experience has led to this: the most advanced DDR4 memory we’ve ever created.  DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB is available in high-performance speeds of up to 4,800MHz – making it the world’s fastest air-cooled production memory – with generous overclocking headroom to push performance even higher.  We start with a custom 10-layer high-performance PCB that guarantees signal quality and stability for superior overclocking ability.  Hand-sorted, tightly-screened memory chips ensure high-frequency performance and tight response times, with overclocking headroom to spare.  Our patented Dual-Path DHX cooling technology cools the memory through both the PCB and the external housing - allowing the module to stay cool even under extreme stress.  Finally, 12 ultra-bright individually addressable CAPELLIX RGB LEDs line the top of the module, shining brighter, lasting longer, and consuming less power than conventional LEDs.  Illuminate your system with dozens of stunning pre-set lighting profiles, or create your own with near-limitless customization. Synchronize your lighting across all your iCUE compatible products, and stay informed with real-time temperature and frequency readings with powerful CORSAIR iCUE software.

		"Description": "Crucial 32GB DDR5 4800MHz U-DIMM Memory Module Faster load times and file transfers Crucial DDR5 Desktop Memory can empower your computer to transfer 50% more data than DDR4 at launch, resulting in faster load times, file transfers, downloads, refresh rates and less lag time. Due to higher bus efficiency, DDR5 technology is not just faster than the previous generation, it’s better. More responsive multitasking Crucial DDR5 offers 50% faster speeds than DDR4 at launch, empowering users with extreme performance right out of the box. Even more impressive, Crucial DDR5 is optimized for enhanced performance and multitasking, not just during testing, but in real-world conditions. Opening more browser tabs and switching between apps now feels more responsive than ever. Extreme innovation for stable performance Crucial DDR5 takes an extreme step forward in engineering over the previous generation with two independent 32-bit channels per module for optimized performance. Designed with on-die ECC (ODECC) at the component level for long-term stability, Crucial DDR5 is engineered to maintain the same reliability as the previous generation, even with the rigorous demands of next-gen computing. Optimized power efficiency For improved efficiency and stability, Crucial DDR5 introduces on-module voltage regulation with a power management integrated circuit (PMIC), which was on the motherboard with older memory technologies. This results in improved signaling and cleaner power for the modules (DIMMs). Moreover, DDR5’s on-module operating voltage is only 1.1V compared to DDR4’s 1.2V.

		"Description": "Adata 32GB DDR5 4800MHz ECC Memory Module AD5U480032G-S Higher Frequencies The DDR5-4800 U-DIMM delivers blazing frequencies of up to 4800 MT/s, a major leap from the max. frequency of DDR4 modules (3200 MT/s) More Energy-Efficient This next-gen memory module operates on just 1.1V, making it 8% more power-efficient than DDR4. What's more, it features a built-in Power Management IC (PMIC) to enhanced power supply stability. Capacity Doubled This memory module's architecture allows for more memory bank groups and banks. With the same area, more bank groups can be packed into the module, doubling what was possible with DDR4, giving you higher capacities. Improved Stability With on-die error correcting code (ECC) this module can correct errors automatically in real-time to provide increased stability and reliability. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Appearance DDR5 U-DIMM modules have the same dimensions and pin count as DDR4 modules. The most obvious difference is the position of the fool-proof notch. Also, DDR5 integrates I/O resistors with CMD/ADD resistors. Also, the appearance of DDR5 modules are cleaner than DDR4. In addition, you can see a PMIC in the center. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Chip Architecture DDR5 modules provide two times more capacity than DDR4 by packing in more banks and bank groups. In addition, Burst Length and Prefetch are also doubled. And to ensure data integrity, they feature error correcting code (ECC) technology. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Performance The biggest change is that bandwidth and frequency are significantly higher. The ADATA DDR5 memory modules deliver frequencies of up to 4800MT/s and feature bandwidth of 38.4GB/s, which is 50% higher than the DDR4-3200. The maximum frequency is increased 1.63 times compared to DDR4.

Generation: 9th Generation Intel® Optane™ Memory Supported  Intel® Optane™ memory is a revolutionary new class of non-volatile memory that sits in between system memory and storage to accelerate system performance and responsiveness. When combined with the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology Driver, it seamlessly manages multiple tiers of storage while presenting one virtual drive to the OS, ensuring that data frequently used resides on the fastest tier of storage. Intel® Optane™ memory requires specific hardware and software configuration.  Intel® Turbo Boost Technology  Intel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x)  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.  Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d)  Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) continues from the existing support for IA-32 (VT-x) and Itanium® processor (VT-i) virtualization adding new support for I/O-device virtualization. Intel VT-d can help end users improve security and reliability of the systems and also improve performance of I/O devices in virtualized environments.  Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT)  Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT), also known as Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), provides acceleration for memory intensive virtualized applications. Extended Page Tables in Intel® Virtualization Technology platforms reduces the memory and power overhead costs and increases battery life through hardware optimization of page table management.  Intel® 64  Intel® 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software.¹ Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.  Instruction Set  An instruction set refers to the basic set of commands and instructions that a microprocessor understands and can carry out. The value shown represents which Intel’s instruction set this processor is compatible with.  Instruction Set Extensions  Instruction Set Extensions are additional instructions which can increase performance when the same operations are performed on multiple data objects. These can include SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions).  Idle States  Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.  Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology  Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.  Thermal Monitoring Technologies  Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.  Intel® Identity Protection Technology  Intel® Identity Protection Technology is a built-in security token technology that helps provide a simple, tamper-resistant method for protecting access to your online customer and business data from threats and fraud. Intel® IPT provides a hardware-based proof of a unique user’s PC to websites, financial institutions, and network services; providing verification that it is not malware attempting to login. Intel® IPT can be a key component in two-factor authentication solutions to protect your information at websites and business log-ins.",

		"Description": "Intel Core i3-12100 CPU - 4-core FCLGA1700 3.3GHz Processor BX8071512100 Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator Intel® Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (GNA) is an ultra-low power accelerator block designed to run audio and speed-centric AI workloads. Intel® GNA is designed to run audio based neural networks at ultra-low power, while simultaneously relieving the CPU of this workload.  Intel® Deep Learning Boost (Intel® DL Boost) A new set of embedded processor technologies designed to accelerate AI deep learning use cases. It extends Intel AVX-512 with a new Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI) that significantly increases deep learning inference performance over previous generations.  Intel® Optane™ Memory Supported Intel® Optane™ memory is a revolutionary new class of non-volatile memory that sits in between system memory and storage to accelerate system performance and responsiveness. When combined with the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology Driver, it seamlessly manages multiple tiers of storage while presenting one virtual drive to the OS, ensuring that data frequently used resides on the fastest tier of storage. Intel® Optane™ memory requires specific hardware and software configuration.  Intel® Speed Shift Technology Intel® Speed Shift Technology uses hardware-controlled P-states to deliver dramatically quicker responsiveness with single-threaded, transient (short duration) workloads, such as web browsing, by allowing the processor to more quickly select its best operating frequency and voltage for optimal performance and power efficiency.  Intel® Turbo Boost Technology Intel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.  Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology) delivers two processing threads per physical core. Highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel, completing tasks sooner.  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.  Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) continues from the existing support for IA-32 (VT-x) and Itanium® processor (VT-i) virtualization adding new support for I/O-device virtualization. Intel VT-d can help end users improve security and reliability of the systems and also improve performance of I/O devices in virtualized environments.  Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT) Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT), also known as Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), provides acceleration for memory intensive virtualized applications. Extended Page Tables in Intel® Virtualization Technology platforms reduces the memory and power overhead costs and increases battery life through hardware optimization of page table management.  Intel® 64 Intel® 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.  Idle States Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.  Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.  Thermal Monitoring Technologies Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.  Intel® Volume Management Device (VMD) Intel® Volume Management Device (VMD) provides a common, robust method of hot plug and LED management for NVMe-based solid state drives.  Intel® AES New Instructions Intel® AES New Instructions (Intel® AES-NI) are a set of instructions that enable fast and secure data encryption and decryption. AES-NI are valuable for a wide range of cryptographic applications, for example: applications that perform bulk encryption/decryption, authentication, random number generation, and authenticated encryption.  Secure Key Intel® Secure Key consists of a digital random number generator that creates truly random numbers to strengthen encryption algorithms.  Execute Disable Bit Execute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.  Intel® Boot Guard Intel® Device Protection Technology with Boot Guard helps protect the system’s pre-OS environment from viruses and malicious software attacks.  Mode-based Execute Control (MBE) Mode-based Execute Control can more reliably verify and enforce the integrity of kernel level code.  Intel® Control-Flow Enforcement Technology CET - Intel Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) helps protect against the misuse of legitimate code snippets through return-oriented programming (ROP) control-flow hijacking attacks.",

		"Description": "ADATA 32GB DDR5 4800 MHz ECC Memory Module Higher Frequencies The DDR5-4800 U-DIMM delivers blazing frequencies of up to 4800 MT/s, a major leap from the max. frequency of DDR4 modules (3200 MT/s) More Energy-Efficient This next-gen memory module operates on just 1.1V, making it 8% more power-efficient than DDR4. What's more, it features a built-in Power Management IC (PMIC) to enhanced power supply stability. Capacity Doubled This memory module's architecture allows for more memory bank groups and banks. With the same area, more bank groups can be packed into the module, doubling what was possible with DDR4, giving you higher capacities. Improved Stability With on-die error correcting code (ECC) this module can correct errors automatically in real-time to provide increased stability and reliability. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Appearance DDR5 U-DIMM modules have the same dimensions and pin count as DDR4 modules. The most obvious difference is the position of the fool-proof notch. Also, DDR5 integrates I/O resistors with CMD/ADD resistors. Also, the appearance of DDR5 modules are cleaner than DDR4. In addition, you can see a PMIC in the center. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Chip Architecture DDR5 modules provide two times more capacity than DDR4 by packing in more banks and bank groups. In addition, Burst Length and Prefetch are also doubled. And to ensure data integrity, they feature error correcting code (ECC) technology. QuikTips: DDR5 vs DDR4 - Performance The biggest change is that bandwidth and frequency are significantly higher. The ADATA DDR5 memory modules deliver frequencies of up to 4800MT/s and feature bandwidth of 38.4GB/s, which is 50% higher than the DDR4-3200. The maximum frequency is increased 1.63 times compared to DDR4.

WINDFORCE 2X COOLING SYSTEM The WINDFORCE 2X cooling system features two unique blade fans, alternate spinning, composite copper heat pipes, copper plate and 3D active fan, which together provide high efficiency heat dissipation.  ALTERNATE SPINNING Alternate Spinning can reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase air pressure.  SMOOTH AIRFLOW GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface.  GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of sleeve bearing fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter.  HEAT PIPES AND COPPER PLATE The shape of the pure copper heat pipe contacts with the GPU through a copper plate.  ULTRA COOLING Lower RDS(on) MOSFETs are specially designed to produce lower switching resistance for faster electric current charging and discharging at extremely low temperature.  LOW POWER LOSS Metal Choke hold energy much longer than common iron-core chokes at high frequency, thus effectively reduce core energy loss and EMI interference.  LONGER LIFE Lower ESR Solid Capacitors ensure better electronic conductivity for excellent system performance and longer lifespan.  FRIENDLY PCB DESIGN Fully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface. This friendly design prevents your hands from getting cut or inadvertently damaging components when making your build.",

It is the most widely used semiconductor memory used in current generation computers, and offers several significant advantages, such as structural simplicity, very high packing densities (number of bytes that can be stored per unit of chip area), low power consumption, and sufficiently high data read/write speeds. Several types of DRAM are presently available for deployment on various computing platforms, such as home/personal computers, portable computers, and network servers. This type of memory has undergone several innovative technological developments and offers very high price/performance ratios.    Two types of DRAM are widely used for deployment in current generation servers: registered memory, and fully-buffered (FB) memory. Both these memory types are commercially available as DIMMs (dual inline memory modules). Registered DIMMs (or RDIMMs) are designed with an additional hardware register between the DRAM module and the system’s memory controller. RDIMMs present several advantages for the system, such as a lower electrical load on the memory controller and sustained stability even with an increase in the number of installed memory modules. Thus, RDIMMs are often the default choice for deployment in server-class computing systems. Fully-buffered DIMMs (or FB-DIMMs) are intended to be used in systems requiring higher memory densities with limited board space. As opposed to the parallel data transfer technique used in normal DRAM, FB-DIMMs transfer data in a serial format, using an additional buffer, known as advanced memory buffer (AMB) between the memory controller and the FB-DIMM modules. The AMB acts as an intermediary and handles all data reads/writes for the memory modules, taking care of issues such as signal degradation and error correction and reducing any overhead on the memory controller. Thus, FB-DIMMs prove to be a reliable alternative for deployment in server-grade machines.",

		"Description": "Intel Core i5-13400 CPU - 13th Gen 4.60 GHz 20 MB Processor BX8071513400 Features Intel Gaussian & Neural Accelerator Intel Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (GNA) is an ultra-low power accelerator block designed to run audio and speed-centric AI workloads. Intel GNA is designed to run audio based neural networks at ultra-low power, while simultaneously relieving the CPU of this workload.  Intel Deep Learning Boost (Intel DL Boost) A new set of embedded processor technologies designed to accelerate AI deep learning use cases. It extends Intel AVX-512 with a new Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI) that significantly increases deep learning inference performance over previous generations.  Intel Speed Shift Technology Intel Speed Shift Technology uses hardware-controlled P-states to deliver dramatically quicker responsiveness with single-threaded, transient (short duration) workloads, such as web browsing, by allowing the processor to more quickly select its best operating frequency and voltage for optimal performance and power efficiency.  Intel Turbo Boost Technology Intel Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.  Intel 64 Intel 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software. Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.  Idle States Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.  Thermal Monitoring Technologies Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.  Intel Volume Management Device (VMD) Intel Volume Management Device (VMD) provides a common, robust method of hot plug and LED management for NVMe-based solid state drives.   Technical Specification Product: Intel Core i5-13400 Processor Family: 13th Generation Intel Core i5 Processor Frequency: 1.80 / 4.60 GHz Total Cores: 10 Total Threads: 16 Cache: 20 MB Intel Smart Cache Processor Socket: LGA 1700 Processor Manufacturer: Intel Memory Channels: Dual-channel Maximum internal memory supported by processor: 128 GB Memory types supported by processor: DDR4-SDRAM, DDR5-SDRAM On-board graphics card model: Intel UHD Graphics 730 Market segment: Desktop",

Memory channels: Dual-channel, Maximum internal memory supported by processor: 128 GB, Memory types supported by processor: DDR4-SDRAM. On-board graphics adapter model: Intel® UHD Graphics 630, Maximum on-board graphics adapter memory: 64 GB, On-board graphics adapter base frequency: 350 MHz. Thermal Design Power (TDP): 65 W. PCI Express configurations: 1x16,2x8,1x8+2x4, Supported instruction sets: SSE4.1,SSE4.2,AVX 2.0, Scalability: 1S Intel® Optane™ Memory Supported  Intel® Optane™ memory is a revolutionary new class of non-volatile memory that sits in between system memory and storage to accelerate system performance and responsiveness. When combined with the Intel® Rapid Storage Technology Driver, it seamlessly manages multiple tiers of storage while presenting one virtual drive to the OS, ensuring that data frequently used resides on the fastest tier of storage. Intel® Optane™ memory requires specific hardware and software configuration.  Intel® Turbo Boost Technology  Intel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.  Intel® vPro™ Platform Eligibility  Intel® vPro™ Technology is a set of security and manageability capabilities built into the processor aimed at addressing four critical areas of IT security: 1) Threat management, including protection from rootkits, viruses, and malware 2) Identity and web site access point protection 3) Confidential personal and business data protection 4) Remote and local monitoring, remediation, and repair of PCs and workstations.  Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology  Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology) delivers two processing threads per physical core. Highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel, completing tasks sooner.  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x)  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.  Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d)  Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) continues from the existing support for IA-32 (VT-x) and Itanium® processor (VT-i) virtualization adding new support for I/O-device virtualization. Intel VT-d can help end users improve security and reliability of the systems and also improve performance of I/O devices in virtualized environments.  Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT)  Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT), also known as Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), provides acceleration for memory intensive virtualized applications. Extended Page Tables in Intel® Virtualization Technology platforms reduces the memory and power overhead costs and increases battery life through hardware optimization of page table management.  Intel® 64  Intel® 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software.¹ Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.  Instruction Set  An instruction set refers to the basic set of commands and instructions that a microprocessor understands and can carry out. The value shown represents which Intel’s instruction set this processor is compatible with.  Instruction Set Extensions  Instruction Set Extensions are additional instructions which can increase performance when the same operations are performed on multiple data objects. These can include SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) and AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions).  Idle States  Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.  Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology  Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.  Thermal Monitoring Technologies  Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.  Intel® Identity Protection Technology  Intel® Identity Protection Technology is a built-in security token technology that helps provide a simple, tamper-resistant method for protecting access to your online customer and business data from threats and fraud. Intel® IPT provides a hardware-based proof of a unique user’s PC to websites, financial institutions, and network services; providing verification that it is not malware attempting to login. Intel® IPT can be a key component in two-factor authentication solutions to protect your information at websites and business log-ins.  Intel® Stable Image Platform Program (SIPP)  Intel® Stable Image Platform Program (Intel® SIPP) can help your company identify and deploy standardized, stable image PC platforms for at least 15 months.",

ALTERNATE SPINNING The GIGABYTE patent “Alternate Spinning” is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of adjacent fans. Since the adjacent fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency. GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface, effectively enhancing the airflow.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game. It allows gamers to enjoy gameplay in complete silence when the system is running light or idle.  ULTRA COOLING Lower RDS(on) MOSFETs are specially designed to produce lower switching resistance for faster electric current charging and discharging at extremely low temperature.  LOW POWER LOSS Metal Choke hold energy much longer than common iron-core chokes at high frequency, thus effectively reduce core energy loss and EMI interference.  LONGER LIFE Lower ESR Solid Capacitors ensure better electronic conductivity for excellent system performance and longer lifespan.  IN TOTAL COMMAND The actual software UI and functionalities depend on each device model.  AORUS ENGINE The cutting edge intuitive interface allows you to adjust the clock speed, voltage, fan performance and power target in real-time according to your game’s requirements.  - Powered by GeForce® GTX 1650 - Integrated with 4GB GDDR5 128-bit memory interface - WINDFORCE 2X Cooling System with alternate spinning fans - 80 mm unique blade fan",

Advanced cooling solutions from flagship graphics cards — including two Axial-tech fans for maximizing airflow to the heatsink — are packed into the 20 cm long, 2-slot card, delivering more power in less space. These enhancements make ASUS Dual the perfect choice for gamers who want heavyweight graphics performance in a compact build.  COOLING  Axial-tech Fan Design Better, faster, stronger Two tried-and-true Axial-tech fans feature a smaller hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring to increase downward air pressure.  0dB Technology Quiet intelligence To eliminate unnecessary noise, a stop mode halts all fans when the GPU temp falls below 50 degrees and power consumption is low.  Dual Ball Fan Bearings 2x longer lifespan Different bearing types have unique pros and cons. Ball bearings excel at durability and can last up to twice as long as sleeve bearing designs.  2-slot Design Sink your heat into this A carefully designed shroud, heatsink, and heatpipe layout allows the two Axial-tech fans to leverage chassis side-panel ventilation and deliver thermal performance that belies the card’s size.  ENGINEERING  Auto-Extreme Technology Precision automated manufacturing Auto-Extreme Technology is an automated manufacturing process that sets new standards in the industry by allowing all soldering to be completed in a single pass. This reduces thermal strain on components and avoids the use of harsh cleaning chemicals, resulting in less environmental impact, lower manufacturing power consumption, and a more reliable product overall.  Protective Backplate That's so metal! The PCB is reinforced by an aluminum backplate that adds structural rigidity, helping to prevent flex and protect components and trace pathways from damage.  Stainless Steel Bracket Steel yourself The mounting bracket of the Dual has been beefed up with 304 Stainless Steel that’s harder and more resistant to corrosion.  SOFTWARE  GPU Tweak II Monitor, tweak, and tune The ASUS GPU Tweak II utility takes graphics card tuning to the next level. It allows you to tweak critical parameters including GPU core clocks, memory frequency, and voltage settings, with the option to monitor everything in real-time through a customizable on-screen display.

		"Description": "Asus ROG Strix Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 OC Edition 8GB GDDR6 Graphics Card 90YV0HI1-M0NA00 TAKE FLIGHT From top to bottom, the ROG Strix GeForce RTX 3050 has been designed to push performance boundaries. A fresh design and more metal surrounds a grouping of Axial-tech fans that leverage a new rotation scheme. Below the blades, a larger, more impressive heatsink is ready for the most demanding thermal loads. The PCB has some new tricks up its sleeves, and even the backplate has received some performance-boosting changes. For gamers who want to get the most out of the NVIDIA Ampere architecture, the latest addition to the ROG Strix stable delivers in every way.  AXIAL-TECH FAN DESIGN Three cutting edge fans feature a smaller hub that facilitates longer blades and a barrier ring to increase downward air pressure.  NEW DIRECTIONS The two side fans spin counterclockwise to reduce turbulence. And to eliminate unnecessary noise, a stop mode halts all fans when the GPU temp falls below 42 degrees and power consumption is low.  MAXCONTACT To get heat up off the die and into the heatsink array to benefit from the new fan design requires special attention. We use a manufacturing process that polishes the surface of the heat spreader to improve smoothness at the microscopic level. The extra flatness allows for better contact with the die for improved thermal transfer.  2.7-SLOT DESIGN The heat spreader draws heat up into heatpipes that carry it through a fin stack that fills most of the card’s large, 2.7-slot footprint.  FRESH SHROUD In addition to under-the-hood design changes, the ROG Strix features a new face with metal accents that mirror the design aesthetic of ROG and ROG Strix motherboards. Textured accents in a greyscale colorway blend seamlessly into subtle builds or make a striking impact while the card is vertically mounted and lit by chassis LEDs.  IT’S COOLER OUT BACK Flipping the card around reveals more design improvements. For enhanced heat dissipation, a wide backplate vent and shortened PCB allow hot air to escape towards chassis exhaust fans instead of being recycled back into the cooler. The I/O bracket is made from stainless steel to protect ports and provide a more secure mount. A conveniently placed Dual BIOS switch allows quick selection between “performance” and “quiet” mode for basic customization of the card’s default behavior without software. To top it off, an ROG logo with addressable RGB backlighting adds flair.  FUNCTIONAL FRONT A new addressable RGB element lines the front edge of the card and can be customized with Armoury Crate software to sync lighting and effects with other ROG components. To fulfill the power demands of the GeForce RTX 3050, an 8-pin power connector is present, along with an onboard circuit that monitors PSU rail voltage. The circuit is fast enough to catch any transients that result in the rail voltage dropping too low. If that happens, a red LED will light up to indicate a power supply issue.",

ALTERNATE SPINNING The GIGABYTE “Alternate Spinning” is the only solution that can solve the turbulent airflow of adjacent fans. Since the adjacent fans rotate in the same direction, the airflow direction is opposite between the fans, which will cause turbulent airflow and reduce heat dissipation efficiency.

Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT): VT-d,VT-x, Compatibility: PowerEdge R430 PowerEdge R530 PowerEdge R630 PowerEdge R730 PowerEdge R730XD PowerEdge T630 Intel® Turbo Boost Technology Intel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.  Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology) delivers two processing threads per physical core. Highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel, completing tasks sooner.  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.  Intel® Trusted Execution Technology Intel® Trusted Execution Technology for safer computing is a versatile set of hardware extensions to Intel® processors and chipsets that enhance the digital office platform with security capabilities such as measured launch and protected execution. It enables an environment where applications can run within their own space, protected from all other software on the system.  AES New Instructions Advanced Encryption Standard New Instructions (AES-NI) are a set of instructions that enable fast and secure data encryption and decryption. AES-NI are valuable for a wide range of cryptographic applications, for example: applications that perform bulk encryption/decryption, anthentication, random number generation, and authenticated encryption.  Intel® 64 Intel® 64 architecture delivers 64-bit computing on server, workstation, desktop and mobile platforms when combined with supporting software.¹ Intel 64 architecture improves performance by allowing systems to address more than 4 GB of both virtual and physical memory.  Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep® Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep® Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.  Thermal Monitoring Technologies Thermal Monitoring Technologies protect the processor package and the system from thermal failure through several thermal management features. An on-die Digital Thermal Sensor (DTS) detects the core's temperature, and the thermal management features reduce package power consumption and thereby temperature when required in order to remain within normal operating limits.  Execute Disable Bit Execute Disable Bit is a hardware-based security feature that can reduce exposure to viruses and malicious-code attacks and prevent harmful software from executing and propagating on the server or network.  Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT) Intel® VT-x with Extended Page Tables (EPT), also known as Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), provides acceleration for memory intensive virtualized applications. Extended Page Tables in Intel® Virtualization Technology platforms reduces the memory and power overhead costs and increases battery life through hardware optimization of page table management.",

		"Description": "Asus ROG Strix Z790-F Gaming Wi-Fi Intel LGA 1700 ATX Motherboard 90MB1CP0-M0EAY0 Beneath its dark heatsinks and brooding aesthetic, the ROG Strix Z790-F packs a power solution and overclocking features that push Intel® 13th Gen Core processors to new heights. Flush with advanced thermal management for quieter builds, along with support for DDR5, PCIe 5.0, and WiFi 6E, this well-equipped powerhouse delivers massive bandwidth for everything.  DIY-FRIENDLY FEATURES  PCIE® SLOT Q-RELEASE A physical button unlocks the first PCIe slot’s security latch with one press, greatly simplifying the process of detaching a PCIe card from the motherboard when it’s time to upgrade to a new GPU or other compatible device.  M.2 Q-LATCH The innovative Q-Latch makes it easy to install or remove an SSD from an M.2 slot. The design employs a simple locking mechanism to secure the drive, eliminating the need for a traditional screw.  CLEAR CMOS The Clear CMOS button quickly resets BIOS settings to factory default. It can also be used to reboot the PC if incorrect BIOS settings have been selected.  BIOS FLASHBACK™ BIOS FlashBack™ is a safe and simple way to update BIOS. Just drop the (UEFI) BIOS file onto a FAT32-formatted USB stick, plug it into the USB BIOS FlashBack port, and press the button. Updates can even be performed without having memory or a CPU installed.  START BUTTON This convenient button removes the need to manually jump hard-to-reach pins during testing and troubleshooting.  Q-LED Four onboard LEDs indicate power status and identify problems with CPU, memory, graphics card, or boot device for quick diagnosis.  ALL-ROUND PERFORMANCE Robust power delivery, speedy storage and memory, and comprehensive cooling elevate any build with the ROG Strix Z790-F at its center.  AI OVERCLOCKING Tuning is now faster and smarter than ever before. ASUS AI Overclocking profiles the CPU and cooling to predict the optimal configuration and push the system to its limits. Predicted values can be engaged automatically or used as a launching ground for further experimentation.  PCIE 5.0 The top PCIe 5.0 x16 SafeSlot is well-equipped for the increased size and bandwidth of next-gen graphics cards. Zippy storage options abound with four PCIe 4.0 M.2 slots, all featuring robust heatsinks to maximize performance.  POWER ARCHITECTURE 16 + 1 power stages rated to 90A each deliver ample current in order to drive 13th and 12th Gen Intel® Core™ Processors through any workload with ease.  ALLOY CHOKES AND DURABLE CAPACITORS Hi-end chokes and durable capacitors are engineered to resist extreme temperatures, enabling performance that exceeds industry standards.  DUAL PROCOOL II POWER CONNECTORS ProCool II connectors are precision-built to ensure flush contact with PSU power lines. A metal sheath improves heat dissipation and lowers electrical impedance.  SIX-LAYER PCB A multi-layered printed circuit board design quickly dissipates heat around the voltage regulators to improve overall system stability and provide the CPU with more overclocking headroom.  DDR5 DOMINATION ROG has a long legacy of flexing the fastest memory performance, and DDR5 is no outlier. Thanks to improved signal routing, now enthusiast-grade kits have been driven far beyond the 7 GT/s mark on the Strix Z790-F, and who knows how far future DIMMs can go? Seasoned veterans can test their mettle by tinkering with the extensive array of tuning options in the UEFI.â€‹  AEMP II ASUS Enhanced Memory Profile (AEMP) is an exclusive hardware and firmware solution to overclock generic memory modules. AEMP’s second version allows for automatic tuning of kits during system startup and leverages the PCB trace optimizations of the Strix Z790-F to push frequencies higher than ever before. AEMP II can even overclock mixed kits in a quad-DIMM arrangement, and the vast library of support now extends to nearly every DDR5 module that does not otherwise have XMP support.  VRM HEATSINK ARRAY Covering the power solution are two thick heatsinks connected by a heatpipe, sharing cooling capacity across VRMs and providing ample surface area and mass to handle the power needs of high-performance Intel 13th Gen processors.â€‹  M.2 BACKPLATEâ€‹ An integrated backplate helps ensure that high-performance drives can deliver peak performance, even when airflow is restricted.  M.2 HEATSINKS Heatsinks cover every slot to help keep onboard NVME SSDs at optimal temperatures for consistent performance and reliability.",

GeForce RTX graphics cards deliver advanced DX12 features like ray tracing and variable rate shading, bringing games to life with ultra-realistic visual effects and faster frame rates.  WINDFORCE 2X COOLING SYSTEM The WINDFORCE 2X cooling system features 2X100mm unique blade fans, alternate spinning, 4 composite copper heat pipes direct touch GPU, 3D active fan and Screen cooling, which together provide high efficiency heat dissipation.  ALTERNATE SPINNING Alternate Spinning can reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase air pressure.  SMOOTH AIRFLOW GIGABYTE turns the adjacent fans in the opposite direction, so that the airflow direction between the two fans is the same, reducing the turbulence and enhancing the airflow pressure.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface.  GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter.  SCREEN COOLING Extended heatsink design allows air flow to pass through, providing better heat dissipation.  HEAT PIPES DIRECT TOUCH The shape of the pure copper heat pipe maximizes the direct contact area with the GPU. The heat pipe also covers the VRAM through a large metal plate contact to ensure proper cooling.  RGB FUSION 2.0 With 16.7M customizable color options and numerous lighting effects, you can choose lighting effects or synchronize with other AORUS devices.  PROTECTION BACK PLATE The back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.  POWER INDICATOR When experiencing any power supply abnormality, the indicator will alert gamers by flashing light.  FRIENDLY PCB DESIGN Fully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface. This friendly design prevents your hands from getting cut or inadvertently damaging components when making your build.  EXTREME DURABILITY AND OVERCLOCKING The graphics card uses the better power phase design to allow the MOSFET to operate at lower temperature, and over-temperature protection design and load balancing for each MOSFET, plus the Ultra Durable certified chokes and capacitors, to provide excellent performance and longer system life.  AORUS ENGINE The cutting edge intuitive interface allows you to adjust the clock speed, voltage, fan performance and power target in real-time according to your game’s requirements.",

It's primed to unleash the full force of the latest 3rd Gen Ryzen Threadripper processors, while keeping thermals in check with a comprehensive cooling solution. Maximized lane bandwidth lets you connect up to 33 devices simultaneously, while every single PCIe x16 and M.2 slot is wired with PCIe® 4.0 – so you're free to equip next-gen graphics cards or NVMe drives without fear of bottlenecks. Massive power, massive bandwidth.  PERFORMANCE High-end desktop processors have greater power requirements due to the abundance of cores and memory channels. The latest Threadripper evolutions are particularly demanding, so intelligent VRM design and quality components are vital – especially for overclocked CPUs that live closer to the edge of stability. Accompanied with our critically-acclaimed UEFI and AI Suite tuning utility, ROG Zenith II Extreme offers an accessible range of manual tweaking tools, plus a highly-configurable auto-tuner that maximizes system control and performance with no expert knowledge required.  Teamed Power Architecture Modern CPU architectures up the ante for motherboard power design by transitioning from deep power saving modes to full load almost instantaneously. Our latest VRM architecture rises to the challenge by utilizing teamed power stages to rapidly swing current, while maintaining exemplary thermal performance.  A brief history We became the first manufacturer to implement phase-doublers when we shipped our A8N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard, back in 2005. The board's VRM was lauded for elegantly overcoming the power handling capabilities of components that were available at the time and also reducing voltage ripple. Those benefits led to phase-doublers becoming universally accepted in the industry, and they are still used for similar purposes today.  A shift in CPU demands However, the current crop of CPUs pack more cores than their predecessors, and the latest instruction sets allow them to crunch computationally-dense workloads at an incredible pace. As an added bonus, they also consume less power at idle and can transition between loads states much more quickly. These improvements necessitate a re-evaluation of power-design priorities because phase-doublers add a propagation delay that hampers transient response.  Bucking the trend Fortunately, the latest integrated power components can handle higher currents than the devices of yesteryear, making it possible to implement a simple circuit topology that isn't hamstrung by the processing lag of phase-doublers. That's why ROG Zenith II Extreme utilizes teamed power stages to deliver higher burst current per phase, while maintaining the thermal performance of phase-doubled designs.  Thermal performance Each VRM component serves a specific purpose. PWM controllers and phase-doublers control the circuit, and the power stages do the heavy lifting from an electrical and thermal standpoint. That's why ROG Zenith II Extreme utilizes 16 Infineon TDA21472 power stages. The TDA21472 sits at the top of Infineon's lineup and features a low RDSON to reduce switching and conduction losses, helping to improve overall thermal headroom.  High quality components Dual 8-pin & one 6-pin ProCool II power connectors Three ProCool II connectors ensure a snug and reliable connection to the EPS 12V power lines.  CONNECTIVITY Having the bandwidth to fuel multiple PCIe SSDs and graphics cards is part of the allure of high-end desktop platforms. ROG Zenith II Extreme fully exploits Threadripper's 64-lane capability, empowering you to connect up to 20 PCIe devices simultaneously. Every single PCIe x16 and M.2 is wired with PCIe 4.0, and the board also accelerates both wired and wireless networking – with both Aquantia 10 Gbps Ethernet and the latest Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) onboard.  Storage ROG Zenith II Extreme supports up to five M.2 drives for maxed-out storage. Two ride the ROG DIMM.2 module, next to the memory slots, and support drives up to 110m. There are another two slots under the aluminum heatsink cover, with a fifth one at the rear of the board. Every one of these slots is wired to support full PCIe 4.0 bandwidth, so they're compatible with the very latest NVMe SSDs – laying the foundation for the ultrafast transfer speeds needed to support machine-learning algorithms and drive higher-resolution game textures.  AMD StoreMI AMD StoreMI is a software utility that accelerates any drive for better system responsiveness with reduced startup and software load times. It combines SSD performance with the affordability and capacity of an HDD by automatically moving frequently accessed data to dedicated SSD storage.  USB The TRX40 platform is aimed at the most discerning content creators, so Zenith II Extreme implements the latest USB standards. Ready-to-use ports are located on the rear I/O panel, and there are front-panel connectors on the motherboard to let you put USB right where you need it.

		"Description": "Intel Core i9-13900 CPU - 13th Gen 5.60 GHz 36 MB Processor BX8071513900 Features Intel Gaussian & Neural Accelerator Intel Gaussian & Neural Accelerator (GNA) is an ultra-low power accelerator block designed to run audio and speed-centric AI workloads. Intel GNA is designed to run audio based neural networks at ultra-low power, while simultaneously relieving the CPU of this workload.  Intel Deep Learning Boost (Intel DL Boost) A new set of embedded processor technologies designed to accelerate AI deep learning use cases. It extends Intel AVX-512 with a new Vector Neural Network Instruction (VNNI) that significantly increases deep learning inference performance over previous generations.  Intel Speed Shift Technology Intel Speed Shift Technology uses hardware-controlled P-states to deliver dramatically quicker responsiveness with single-threaded, transient (short duration) workloads, such as web browsing, by allowing the processor to more quickly select its best operating frequency and voltage for optimal performance and power efficiency.  Intel Thermal Velocity Boost Intel Thermal Velocity Boost (Intel TVB) is a feature that opportunistically and automatically increases clock frequency above single-core and multi-core Intel Turbo Boost Technology frequencies based on how much the processor is operating below its maximum temperature and whether turbo power budget is available. The frequency gain and duration is dependent on the workload, capabilities of the processor and the processor cooling solution.  Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Intel Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 identifies the best performing core(s) on a processor and provides increased performance on those cores through increasing frequency as needed by taking advantage of power and thermal headroom.  Intel Hyper-Threading Technology Intel Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel HT Technology) delivers two processing threads per physical core. Highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel, completing tasks sooner.  Idle States Idle States (C-states) are used to save power when the processor is idle. C0 is the operational state, meaning that the CPU is doing useful work. C1 is the first idle state, C2 the second, and so on, where more power saving actions are taken for numerically higher C-states.  Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology is an advanced means of enabling high performance while meeting the power-conservation needs of mobile systems. Conventional Intel SpeedStep Technology switches both voltage and frequency in tandem between high and low levels in response to processor load. Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology builds upon that architecture using design strategies such as Separation between Voltage and Frequency Changes, and Clock Partitioning and Recovery.   Technical Specification Product: Intel Core i9-13900 Processor Family: 13th Generation Intel Core i9 Processor Frequency: 1.50 / 5.60 GHz Total Cores: 24 Total Threads: 32 Cache: 36 MB Intel Smart Cache Processor Socket: LGA 1700 Processor Manufacturer: Intel Memory Channels: Dual-channel Maximum internal memory supported by processor: 128 GB Memory types supported by processor: DDR4-SDRAM, DDR5-SDRAM On-board graphics card model: Intel UHD Graphics 770 Thermal Solution Specification: PCG 2020C Market segment: Desktop",

		"Description": "Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Eagle OC 12GB GDDR6X Graphics Card GV-N407TEAGLE OC-12GD Features WINDFORCE COOLING SYSTEM The WINDFORCE cooling system features three 90mm unique blade fans, alternate spinning, 6 composite copper heat pipes, a vapor chamber directly touches the GPU, 3D active fans and Screen cooling, which together provide high efficiency heat dissipation.  ALTERNATE SPINNING Reduce the turbulence of adjacent fans and increase airflow pressure.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  UNIQUE BLADE FAN The airflow is spilt by the triangular fan edge, and guided smoothly through the 3D stripe curve on the fan surface.  GRAPHENE NANO LUBRICANT Graphene nano lubricant can extend the life of sleeve bearing fan by 2.1 times, close to the life of double ball bearing, and is quieter.  VAPOR CHAMBER & HEAT-PIPE The vapor chamber directly contacts the GPU, coupled with the composite heat pipes, which quickly transfers the heat of the GPU and VRAM to the heatsink.  SCREEN COOLING Extended heatsink allows air to pass through, providing better heat dissipation.  RGB FUSION With 16.7M customizable color options and numerous lighting effects, you can choose any lighting effect or synchronize with other devices in GIGABYTE CONTROL CENTER.  PROTECTION METAL BACK PLATE The metal back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.  DUAL BIOS The factory default setting is OC mode, which provides users with the best performance. However, switching to silent mode will enjoy a quieter experience.  POWER INDICATORS When experiencing any power supply abnormality, the indicator will alert gamers by flashing light.  ANTI-SAG BRACKET The new anti-sag bracket is tailored to each graphics card. It provides the optimized reinforcement and better overall visual appearance.  ULTRA DURABLE Ultra Durable certified highest-grade metal chokes, lower ESR solid capacitors, 2oz copper PCB, and lower RDS(on) MOSFETs, plus over-temperature design to deliver superior performance and longer system life.  FRIENDLY PCB DESIGN Fully automated production process ensures top quality of the circuit boards and eliminates sharp protrusions of the solder connectors seen on the conventional PCB surface.

		"Description": "MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Suprim X 12G 12GB GDDR6X Graphics Card RTX 4070 TI SUPRIM X 12G SUPRIM and its logo concept are inpired by diamond crystals and geometry.  A celebration of decades of MSI graphics card mastery, SUPRIM is crafted with qualities that evoke prestige.  High-quality materials and construction are emphasized by the geometry of points, lines, and planes.  New Streaming Multiprocessors Up to 2x performance and power efficiency  Fourth-Gen Tensor Cores Up to 4x performance with DLSS 3 vs. brute-force rendering  Third-Gen RT Cores Up to 2x ray tracing performance  CHANGE THE GAME Ascend to a superior experience with SUPRIM. See, hear, and feel a profoundly elevated graphics card built with high-quality materials and assembled with enthusiast features.  01. SHARP LOOKS The second iteration of SUPRIM inherits the exterior design philosophy of its predecessor, with a brushed metal cover, octagon-shaped fan cutouts and chevrons around each fan.  02. POLISHED EDGES Beveled edges are polished several times with a diamond-tipped cutter to achieve a mirror-finish. Clean sharp lines emphasize the metal construction to sight and touch.  03. FINISHING TOUCHES The motif of straight lines continue around the fans with octagonal cutouts featuring polished 45-degree beveled edges.  TRI-FROZR 3S THERMAL DESIGN Upgraded fans, airflow control, and other thermal innovation make TRI-FROZR 3S the best air-cooling solution yet from MSI.  TORX FAN 5.0 incorporates design improvements that result in +23% increased airflow compared to an axial fan.  CORE PIPE Core Pipes are precision-crafted to make maximum use of the available space. A squared section of heat pipes fully touch the GPU baseplate to then spread heat along the full length of the heatsink.  FILLED FINS Updated heat pipe pathing has allowed more space for additional heatsink fins  WAVE-CURVED 3.0 Additional efficiency is gained by adjusting the size of the wave edges under the fan motor and other spots where there is less airflow..  AIR ANTEGRADE FIN Fins with a V-shaped cutout are located at the airflow passthrough to improve flow efficiency. Optimizing the inclination angle and increasing the wave notch shapes the air resistance towards the center, pushing out warm air faster like a nozzle.  METAL BACKPLATE Thermal pads under the sturdy metal backplate provide additional cooling while the flow-through ventilation reduces trapped heat.  ZERO FROZR The fans completely stop when temperatures are relatively low, eliminating all noise when active cooling is not needed. The fans will automatically start spinning again when the heat is on during gaming.  DOUBLE-BALL BEARING Two sets of durable ball bearings spin the TORX FANs for years of intense and lengthy gaming sessions.  High-Efficiency CarbonyI Inductors (HCI) Manufacturing and material improvements to our choke parts have culminated as High-Efficiency Carbonyl Inductors (HCI.) One-piece molding allows this design to operate with less choke noise and better electric filtering.  DrMos DrMOS power stage solutions provide great efficiency with low power loss and enhanced voltage controls.  Dual BIOS Dual BIOS gives you the choice to prioritize full performance in GAMING mode or low noise in SILENT mode.  Hardened Defenses - Fuse Additional fuses built into the custom PCB provide additional safeguards against electrical damage.  RELENTLESS DEFENSE A die-cast anti-bending plate reinforces the whole card while thermal pads allow cooling to reach critical component underneath.  BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER MSI's exclusive MSI Center software helps you get the most out of your MSI products. Monitor, tweak, and optimize in real-time with just a few clicks.",

Memory channels: Hexa-channel, Maximum internal memory supported by processor: 1024 GB, Memory types supported by processor: DDR4-SDRAM. Supported instruction sets: AVX-512, Scalability: 2S. Processor package size: 76.0 x 56.5 mm Intel® Turbo Boost Technology  Intel® Turbo Boost Technology dynamically increases the processor's frequency as needed by taking advantage of thermal and power headroom to give you a burst of speed when you need it, and increased energy efficiency when you don’t.  Intel® vPro™ Platform Eligibility  Intel® vPro™ Technology is a set of security and manageability capabilities built into the processor aimed at addressing four critical areas of IT security: 1) Threat management, including protection from rootkits, viruses, and malware 2) Identity and web site access point protection 3) Confidential personal and business data protection 4) Remote and local monitoring, remediation, and repair of PCs and workstations.  Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology  Intel® Hyper-Threading Technology (Intel® HT Technology) delivers two processing threads per physical core. Highly threaded applications can get more work done in parallel, completing tasks sooner.  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x)  Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.  Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d)  Intel® Virtualization Technology for Directed I/O (VT-d) continues from the existing support for IA-32 (VT-x) and Itanium® processor (VT-i) virtualization adding new support for I/O-device virtualization. Intel VT-d can help end users improve security and reliability of the systems and also improve performance of I/O devices in virtualized environments.

COOLING, UPSCALED. AORUS BIONIC FAN TECH The sharks’ dermal denticles surrounding their body grant them significant advantages in fluid dynamics. Now AORUS features new Bionic Fan Tech that mimics the scale micro-surfacing and efficiently increases airflow by reducing micro turbulence.  DOUBLE BALL BEARING The double ball bearing structure has better heat endurance and efficiency than sleeve.  DIRECTLY. SO FAST. LARGE VAPOR CHAMBER & HEAT-PIPE The large vapor chamber directly contacts the GPU, coupled with the composite heat pipes, which quickly transfers the heat of the GPU and VRAM to the heatsink.  THE OTHER WAY AROUND. ALTERNATE SPINNING Each fan rotates in different direction to the adjacent one. This special mechanism reduces turbulence and increases air pressure by minimizing the offset occurred between airflows.  3D ACTIVE FAN The 3D Active Fan provides semi-passive cooling, and the fans will remain off when the GPU is in a low load or low power game.  MAKE ROOM FOR THE AIRFLOW. SCREEN COOLING To create more space for airflow to pass through, the heatsink extends over the PCB and therefore increase the ventilation. This Screen Cooling design provides better heat dissipation.  LCD EDGE VIEW The LCD monitor displays not only graphics card information, but also various favorite texts, pictures, and GIFs. You can also adjust lighting effects via GIGABYTE CONTROL CENTER.  DUAL BIOS The factory default setting is OC mode, which provides users with the best performance. However, switching to silent mode will enjoy a quieter experience.  PROTECTION METAL BACK PLATE The metal back plate not only provides an aesthetical shape, but also enhances the structure of the graphics card to provide complete protection.

		"Description": "Lenovo EPYC AMD 7302. Processor family: AMD EPYC, Processor socket: Socket SP3, Component for: Server/workstation. Memory channels: Octa-channel, Memory types supported by processor: DDR4-SDRAM, Memory clock speeds supported by processor: 3200 MHz2nd Gen AMD EPYC are a new breed of server processors which sets a higher standard for data centers.  Groundbreaking design makes AMD EPYC #1 in performance across industry standard benchmarks, holding 80 world records to date. Performance you can count on to propel your modern data center workloads. ’Hardened at the Core’ protection helps defend against side-channel attacks and EPYC's secure encrypted virtualization features help keep your data safe. The processor’s agility helps you manage new deployments and changing workloads, with the system resources you need, simply and cost-effectively. AMD is the server processor company you can count on for innovation and leadership today and into the future.  Performance Leadership Virtually everything runs better on AMD EPYC 7002 Series powered servers. Whether you run enterprise applications, virtualized and cloud computing environments, software-defined infrastructure, high-performance computing, or data analytic applications. EPYC processor-based systems are #1 on industry benchmarks, including those measuring integer, floating-point, virtualization, database, and HPC performance. AMD EPYC 7742 processor has set new world records that establish AMD as THE performance leader.  The secret is under the hood AMD Infinity Architecture is a hybrid multi-die architecture that is reaching new heights with AMD EPYC 7002 Series processors. AMD Infinity Architecture now decouples two streams: eight dies for the processor cores, and one I/O die that supports security and communication outside the processor. With the agility to deliver the leading-edge process technology for CPU cores while letting I/O circuitry develop at its own rate, new capabilities can be brought to market faster with EPYC because its die design is not monolithic. This has allowed EPYC to race to leadership in the market and continue to innovate in the future.  Forged from the finest silicon AMD is first to market an x86 processor based on 7nm technology. With double the core density and optimizations that improve instructions per cycle, the result is 4x the Floating-Point performance of 1st Gen AMD EPYC.  7nm process technology also brings energy efficiency. 2nd Gen AMD EPYC can provide the same performance at half the power consumption.  EPYC by the numbers AMD EPYC has been engineered for data centers that rely on CPU performance. From oil and gas exploration, to in-memory databases, to big data analytics to production rendering to standard data center applications, highly parallel workloads have more cores to work with. AMD EPYC 7002 generation processors scale from 8 to 64 cores (16 to 128 threads per socket). No other x86 vendor today enables such a core density in the market.  Be top of the security chain AMD EPYC is ‘Hardened at the Core’ with advanced security features. It is the first server CPU with an integrated and dedicated security processor providing the foundation for Secure Boot, Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). So you can worry less about data risk and focus more on running your business.  Enabling software boot without corruption The AMD EPYC processor secure root of trust is designed to validate the initial BIOS software boot without corruption. In virtualized environments, you can cryptographically check that your entire software stack is booted without corruption on a cloud server or services you choose.   Restrict internal vulnerabilities With encrypted memory, attacks on the integrity of main memory (such as cold-boot attacks) are inhibited because any data obtained is encrypted. High-performance encryption engines integrated into the memory channels help speed performance. All of this is accomplished without modifications to your application software.  Safeguarding virtual and cloud infrastructure 2nd Gen EPYC helps safeguard privacy and integrity by encrypting each virtual machine with one of up to 509 unique encryption keys known only to the processor. This aids in protecting confidentiality of your data even if a malicious virtual machine finds a way into your virtual machine’s memory, or a compromised hypervisor reaches into a guest virtual machine.  All-in feature set AMD takes pride in having transparent relationships with its partners and customers. This means having an “all-in” feature set that isn’t contrived to extract higher prices from customers.  With AMD EPYC, you have the agility to choose the processor your application requires without worrying about whether an important feature or capability is included. Whatever the number of cores you choose, you’ll have the I/O, memory, and memory bandwidth to accomplish what you need.  First-to-market PCIe 4.0 readiness AMD EPYC is the first and only current x86-architecture server processor supporting PCIe 4.06. PCIe 4.0 delivers double the I/O performance over PCIe 3.0. You can use 128 lanes of I/O to double the network bandwidth that ties together HPC clusters and satisfies voracious needs for east-west bandwidth. For other application needs and in virtualized environments, you can connect with higher speed to GPU accelerators, NVMe drives, and you can even use integrated disk controllers to access spinning disks without the typical bottleneck of a PCIe RAID controller.  X86 compatibility You can have confidence in AMD EPYC 7002 generation processors because virtually all software will just work. We work with the open source community and major software vendors to help ensure your applications and enabling software will work exceptionally well with EPYC. The broad ecosystem of open tools and libraries are more reasons why top cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud are providing services to customers based on AMD EPYC processors.  1-Socket EPYC server advantage Traditional CPUs typically must scale up to a 2-socket server to overcome an imbalance of resources. With AMD EPYC, 1-socket servers satisfy most of your workload needs, helping you increase density and reduce capital, power, and cooling expenses.  With a 1-socket EPYC server, you can cut licensing costs up to 50% with ‘per-socket software’ such as VMware vSphere or vSAN.",

With double the core density and optimizations that improve instructions per cycle, the result is 4x the Floating-Point performance of 1st Gen AMD EPYC.  7nm process technology also brings energy efficiency. 2nd Gen AMD EPYC can provide the same performance at half the power consumption.  EPYC by the numbers AMD EPYC has been engineered for data centers that rely on CPU performance. From oil and gas exploration, to in-memory databases, to big data analytics to production rendering to standard data center applications, highly parallel workloads have more cores to work with. AMD EPYC 7002 generation processors scale from 8 to 64 cores (16 to 128 threads per socket). No other x86 vendor today enables such a core density in the market.  Be top of the security chain AMD EPYC is ‘Hardened at the Core’ with advanced security features. It is the first server CPU with an integrated and dedicated security processor providing the foundation for Secure Boot, Secure Memory Encryption (SME) and Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV). So you can worry less about data risk and focus more on running your business.  Enabling software boot without corruption The AMD EPYC processor secure root of trust is designed to validate the initial BIOS software boot without corruption. In virtualized environments, you can cryptographically check that your entire software stack is booted without corruption on a cloud server or services you choose.   Restrict internal vulnerabilities With encrypted memory, attacks on the integrity of main memory (such as cold-boot attacks) are inhibited because any data obtained is encrypted. High-performance encryption engines integrated into the memory channels help speed performance. All of this is accomplished without modifications to your application software.  Safeguarding virtual and cloud infrastructure 2nd Gen EPYC helps safeguard privacy and integrity by encrypting each virtual machine with one of up to 509 unique encryption keys known only to the processor. This aids in protecting confidentiality of your data even if a malicious virtual machine finds a way into your virtual machine’s memory, or a compromised hypervisor reaches into a guest virtual machine.  All-in feature set AMD takes pride in having transparent relationships with its partners and customers. This means having an “all-in” feature set that isn’t contrived to extract higher prices from customers.  With AMD EPYC, you have the agility to choose the processor your application requires without worrying about whether an important feature or capability is included. Whatever the number of cores you choose, you’ll have the I/O, memory, and memory bandwidth to accomplish what you need.  First-to-market PCIe 4.0 readiness AMD EPYC is the first and only current x86-architecture server processor supporting PCIe 4.06. PCIe 4.0 delivers double the I/O performance over PCIe 3.0. You can use 128 lanes of I/O to double the network bandwidth that ties together HPC clusters and satisfies voracious needs for east-west bandwidth. For other application needs and in virtualized environments, you can connect with higher speed to GPU accelerators, NVMe drives, and you can even use integrated disk controllers to access spinning disks without the typical bottleneck of a PCIe RAID controller.  X86 compatibility You can have confidence in AMD EPYC 7002 generation processors because virtually all software will just work. We work with the open source community and major software vendors to help ensure your applications and enabling software will work exceptionally well with EPYC. The broad ecosystem of open tools and libraries are more reasons why top cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud are providing services to customers based on AMD EPYC processors.  1-Socket EPYC server advantage Traditional CPUs typically must scale up to a 2-socket server to overcome an imbalance of resources. With AMD EPYC, 1-socket servers satisfy most of your workload needs, helping you increase density and reduce capital, power, and cooling expenses.  With a 1-socket EPYC server, you can cut licensing costs up to 50% with ‘per-socket software’ such as VMware vSphere or vSAN.",

		"Description": "Asus ROG Strix Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 24GB GDDR6X Graphics Card 90YV0ID0-M0NA00 WITH THE INCREDIBLE SUM OF ITS PARTS The ROG Strix GeForce RTX® 4090 brings a whole new meaning to going with the flow. Inside and out, every element of the card gives the monstrous GPU headroom to breathe freely and achieve ultimate performance. The unleashed reign of the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture is here. Axial-tech Upgrades A Fresh Spin Bigger and better. Axial-tech fans spin on dual-ball bearings and have been scaled up to propel 23% more air through the card, setting the stage for lower temperatures, less noise, and higher performance. Reverse Rotation and 0dB Technology Orchestrated Chill The two side fans spin counterclockwise to minimize turbulence and maximize air dispersion through the heatsink. All three fans come to a standstill when GPU temps are below 50 Celsius, letting you play less-demanding games or perform light tasks in relative silence. Fans start up again when temps are over 55 C, referencing a speed curve that balances performance and acoustics for work or play. 3.5-slot Design Through Thick and Fin The custom sink is generously sized and structured to soak up heat from the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU so that it can be efficiently whisked away by the three Axial-tech fans. Patented Vapor Chamber Phase Changer A vapor chamber featuring milled pathways lets the heatpipes sink in without being pressed flat, allowing heat to be carried more efficiently to the fin stack. In comparison to conventional vapor chamber and heatpipe combos, this potent pairing reduces GPU temperature by up to 5 Celsius when subjected to a 500W thermal load. Premium Power Delivery 1st Responder Digital power control, an array of high-current power stages, and a lineup of 15K caps ensure massive reserves to reliably push performance boundaries. Hook up Two PWM FanConnect headers provide additional DIY flexibility. Chassis fans can be directly attached to the card and tuned with a curve that is based on CPU and GPU temperatures, delivering extra intake or exhaust for demanding 3D tasks. Additional Perks A GPU bracket provides extra stability to the critical connection between die and heat spreader. The rear I/O bracket is made from stainless steel to prevent corrosion in humid climates and provide a more resilient mount. A conveniently placed Dual Bios switch allows quick selection between “performance” and “quiet” speed profiles for the Axial-tech fans. Quick Diagnosis Know if your PSU is worthy. ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4090 graphics cards feature a high-speed circuit that constantly monitors input power from the PSU and utilizes conveniently placed LEDs to indicate voltage regulation issues and cable connection problems. Reliability Boost Auto-Extreme Technology is an automated manufacturing process that sets new standards in the industry by allowing all soldering to be completed in a single pass. This reduces thermal strain on components and avoids the use of harsh cleaning chemicals, resulting in less environmental impact, lower manufacturing power consumption, and a more reliable product overall. Symphony of Light Aura-compatible ARGB lighting elements on the shroud and rightmost perimeter of the card provide endless possibilities for personalization with color or functional effects. Pair up with a vast range of compatible system components and coordinate the glow to create a build that’s uniquely you.  - NVIDIA Ada Lovelace Streaming Multiprocessors: Up to 2x performance and power efficiency - 4th Generation Tensor Cores: Up to 2X AI performance - 3rd Generation RT Cores: Up to 2X ray tracing performance - Axial-tech fans scaled up for 23% more airflow - New patented vapor chamber with milled heatspreader for lower GPU temps - 3.5-slot design: massive fin array optimized for airflow from the three Axial-tech fans - Diecast shroud, frame, and backplate add rigidity and are vented to further maximize airflow and heat dissipation - Digital power control with high-current power stages and 15K capacitors to fuel maximum performance - Auto-Extreme precision automated manufacturing for higher reliability - GPU Tweak III software provides intuitive performance tweaking, thermal controls, and system monitoring  Graphics processor family: NVIDIA, Graphics processor: GeForce RTX 4090.
